# API Engineering

## Background

I am passionate to teach IT skills and doing it for few years now. By the end of 2021, I felt we needed a better plan based on  years of teaching. So, started working with group of friends on a Community Initiative to upskill IT professionals in NJ.

I felt this documentation is due as we focus on one of the key subject "API Engineering".
